# Dijkestra
Graphical Dijkestra Algorithm 
This program can be used in Algorithms courses to teach shortest path dijkestra algorithm to students.

The graphical enivronment of this program  allows user to see what is happening during algorithm excution step by step.

at the first click on the black area to add nodes to the network, then connect nodes by right click and set a distance on edges, then use Dijkestra algorithms to find shortest path
